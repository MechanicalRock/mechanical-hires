# mechanical-hires
This is our general approach to hiring

## What is interesting to us
- How do you think?
- Are you passionate about your industry? How is that demonstrated?
- How do you define quality?

## The first meeting
Someone will meet with you face to face and have a coffee. Don't expect to be asked the normal questions you may get in an interview. This will generally just be to see how you communicate and what you want from life. It's not all about work you know?

## The second meeting
A pairing session. 
Depending on the role we are recruiting for, we will generally run a pairing session. Even for non-technical roles, this can be useful.
  - Expect to work test first
  - Expect to understand and elaborate a new domain
  
## The third meeting
It's important to us that the team decide on new hires. After all, you will be part of that team.
We may invite you to a mob programming session. Mob programming (or just "mobbing") is a technique where the entire team works together on a single story at the same time, on the same computer. It takes pair programming to the next level by including everyone.

## IMPORTANT
We can't and won't hire everyone. It may be that you were unsuccessful at some point, but that shouldn't discourage you from applying again. We should provide you with constructive feedback and if we didn't hassle us and we will.

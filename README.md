# mechanical-hires
This is our general approach to hiring

## The first meeting
Someone will meet with you face to face and have a coffee. Don't expect to be asked the normal questions you may get in an interview. This will generally just be to see how you communicate.

## The second meeting
A pairing session. 
Depending on the role we are recruiting for, we will generally run a pairing session. Even for non-technical roles, this can be useful.
  - Expect to work test first
  - Expect to understand and elaborate a new domain
  
## The third meeting
It's important to us that the team decide on new hires. After all, you will be part of that team.
We may invite you to a mob programming session. Mob programming (or just "mobbing") is a technique where the entire team works together on a single story at the same time, on the same computer. It takes pair programming to the next level by including everyone.
